## Literature Review

- **Market Size & Credit Usage:** 51% of Americans are middle-class, with credit utilization on par with upper-income earners.  
- **Psychographics:** Experience-based spending drives loyalty; 47% buy brands they love.  
- **Financial Literacy Gaps:** High debt-to-income ratios and limited financial know-how affect credit-card uptake.  
- **Digital Engagement:** 98–99% internet adoption; 68% engage more with personalized ads.

## Proposed Strategies

1. **Emphasize Travel Rewards:** Highlight miles on everyday spending, airport perks, and hotel discounts.  
2. **Promise of Experience:** Tap emotional appeal—exclusive destinations, memorable perks.  
3. **Financial Guidance:** Embed short videos on responsible credit use within the card’s app/website.  
4. **Interest-Based Personalization:** Combine formal (in-person reps) and informal (tailored digital ads) channels to build trust.
